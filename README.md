# **About Airbnb**

Airbnb is a platform that allows people to rent out their homes or spare rooms to travelers as a form of accommodation. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has grown rapidly and is now available in over 220 countries and regions around the world. The company aims to provide a unique and personalized travel experience for its users by offering a variety of lodging options, from shared rooms to entire homes and apartments. Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hospitality industry by providing an alternative form of accommodation that often offers more affordable and authentic options for travelers. The analysis of data on millions of listings available on Airbnb is an essential aspect for the company.

# **Project Summary -**

The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset consists of information on 48,895 Airbnb listings in New York City, and the main objective of this project was to conduct an EDA of the dataset to obtain valuable insights into the Airbnb market in the city. To accomplish this goal, the EDA was divided into two primary phases: data cleaning and preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.

The first stage involved identifying and addressing missing or inconsistent data, eliminating irrelevant variables and outliers, and ensuring that the data was appropriate for analysis. Following the data cleaning and preprocessing, the exploratory analysis was carried out, which involved examining the variables' distribution, identifying patterns and relationships between variables, and using visualizations to obtain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City. This process revealed some interesting findings, such as the most popular neighborhoods, the most common room types, the average price of listings in different neighbourhoods etc.

The report presented the EDA insights and recommendations for both Airbnb hosts and the company. The recommendations for hosts in high-demand neighborhoods suggested they offer discounts to gain a competitive edge, while those in less popular areas should consider lowering their prices or providing more significant discounts to attract more guests.

This project demonstrated the importance of data analysis in comprehending and enhancing business performance. Through analyzing the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset, valuable insights were acquired, which could be used by Airbnb hosts and the company to make correct decisions. The project emphasizes the potential of data analysis to improve business performance and highlights the significance of making data-driven decisions.
